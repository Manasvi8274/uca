when do conponent re render:-
    state change, parent re-render then child re-render , prop
component:-
    function , reusablee code
why root element :-
    bcs root make full html to react make a root element which is controlled by react
why react:-
    simplified,create a function only html can be done by react,automatically re reender the component
why react instead of angular:-
    if use angular only use angular no other but react can be molded to different language easily


command to use :-
    1)npm create vite
    2)project name and choose react and js
    3)change directory
    4)npm install
    //to run
    5)npm run dev

to change port :- go to line no. 7 in package.json in vite then add --port portnumber

if we use .js or .jsx there is no impact as they bot are same for react but only .jsx has to be converted to .js

NOTE  --- : if we use small starting character it does not work but if we do big case starting then it works
            but if we create a file with small the when importing in anyfile use "as big case alphabet starter"
